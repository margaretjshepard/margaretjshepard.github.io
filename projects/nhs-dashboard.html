                This project focused on analysing UK National Health Service (NHS) hospital admissions data by reverse‑engineering an existing Tableau dashboard and rebuilding it with improved readability, usability and analytical depth【661502244435893†screenshot】. The original dashboard used a dark theme and dense information display. Our goal was to create a redesigned visualisation that communicated the data more clearly and allowed users to filter and explore admissions trends interactively.

                In the deconstruction phase we rebuilt the original dashboard from scratch to understand its structure, data sources and visualisation techniques. Once we understood how the original was assembled, we embarked on the reconstruction phase, designing a new layout with better colour contrast, a lighter theme and clearer data presentation. We added interactive filters so users could slice the data by time period, hospital trust and admission type, as well as new visual elements to highlight key trends and insights over time【661502244435893†screenshot】.

                The finished dashboard made it easier for stakeholders to analyse admissions patterns and identify areas of concern. In a classroom presentation we discussed the reverse‑engineering process, key findings and the improvements achieved in the reconstructed version. This project honed our Tableau skills and demonstrated the importance of effective data storytelling.
