                Heart Smart is a predictive analytics project that explores whether we can anticipate heart attack occurrences based on an individual’s medical history, demographic attributes and lifestyle factors. The underlying dataset contains 35 variables, including age, sex, BMI, various diseases (heart disease, stroke, asthma, skin cancer, COPD, depression, kidney disease, arthritis and diabetes), smoking status, e‑cigarette use, race, alcohol consumption, test results (HIV, flu and pneumococcal vaccines, COVID‑19), and whether a heart attack occurred【33575559337934†screenshot】.

                Our research question asked if these factors could be used to predict who might suffer a heart attack【33575559337934†screenshot】. We proposed building several predictive models, including logistic regression and k‑nearest neighbours (KNN), and using explanatory methods to identify the most influential variables. After cleaning and preparing the data, we trained and evaluated both models to determine which provided the most accurate predictions. In addition to the modelling, we focused on clear communication of results, making complex medical data accessible to non‑technical stakeholders.

                The project emphasised the importance of careful feature selection and model evaluation when dealing with imbalanced health datasets. It also underscored ethical considerations around using predictive analytics in healthcare. In our presentation we outlined the variables, modelling techniques, evaluation metrics and our recommendations for future work.
