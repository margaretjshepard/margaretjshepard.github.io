                Robust Logic &amp; Accuracy Testing (RLAT) is a research project aimed at improving election security by making logic and accuracy testing more reliable and systematic. Traditional Logic and Accuracy Testing (LAT) can miss critical misconfigurations, especially when candidate names are swapped or test decks are poorly constructed. RLAT uses mixed‑integer linear programming and cutting‑plane optimisation to generate test decks that guarantee detection of misconfigurations, thereby increasing confidence in election outcomes【921226932048088†screenshot】.

                The goal of the research is to develop a scalable and cost‑effective verification method that election officials can use prior to election day【921226932048088†screenshot】. In experiments following Michigan’s 2022 election, RLAT required only 1.2 percent more test ballots than traditional LAT while greatly improving error detection. Over 90 percent of the test‑deck calculations completed in under 2.5 minutes, showing RLAT’s efficiency. RLAT was later piloted in Michigan’s 2023 elections, demonstrating its practicality for enhancing election integrity.

                This project highlights how optimisation techniques can be applied to real‑world governance problems. By guaranteeing detection of misconfigurations, RLAT represents a low‑cost, scalable tool for election officials seeking to strengthen the public’s trust in election systems.
