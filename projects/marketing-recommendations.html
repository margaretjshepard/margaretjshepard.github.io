                mArketIng is a recommendation engine designed to analyse customer ratings and generate personalized product suggestions. The objective was to demonstrate how businesses can use machine learning to deliver more tailored experiences, boosting customer satisfaction and ultimately increasing revenue【244370752019532†screenshot】.

                We used the Goodbooks‑10K dataset, which contains 981,756 ratings from 53,424 users across 10,000 books【244370752019532†screenshot】. After cleaning and normalising the data, we built a TensorFlow Recommenders model to learn user preferences and predict ratings. The model suggests books a user might enjoy and estimates how they would rate each one. To make the project accessible, we created an interactive web app where users can enter their user ID and receive tailored book recommendations along with predicted ratings and book cover images.【244370752019532†screenshot】

                During the presentation we walked through the methodology, showcased the live demo and discussed potential improvements, such as incorporating user feedback to refine the model and expanding the system to recommend products beyond books. This project illustrates how recommendation systems can transform raw behavioural data into actionable marketing insights.
